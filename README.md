# Rust std library on ESP32 C3 RISC-V boards playground

In this project I am playing with ESP32 C3 RISC-V based board, with the `std` library (another option would be using the `no-std` - bare-metal -, but I discarded it because I want to be as close to higher level application development as possible).

## Base Setup

I started my journey from the official [Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/introduction.html).

In case you want to go fast without going though the book, try following the next steps:

- Rust installation via `rustup`, and required dependencies via `espup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install ldproxy
rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src  # since we are targetting RISC-V based boards
cargo install espup
espup install  # IMPORTANT to add to your shell profile the following line: . $HOME/export-esp.sh
cargo install cargo-espflash
cargo install espflash
cargo install cargo-espmonitor
cargo install espmonitor
```

**NOTE**: as already mentioned, and if any issue, please follow the book mentioned above ðŸ«°

- Generated a base repo via `cargo generate` with the official `esp-idf-template` template:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo
```

**NOTE**: you will need to give it a `project` name, select the MCU `esp32c3`, set `true` for STD support, set `false` for DevContainers, and select `ESP-IDF` native build version (I did select v4.4, which was the current stable back then).

- Check that the board is connected and ready to be used. In the new generated repo path, run:

```bash
cargo espflash board-info
```

- Setup the IDE extensions:

Since I am using VSCode I installed the following extensions for [Rust](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/tooling/text-editors-and-ides.html#visual-studio-code).

And also the `CodeLLDB` extension.

## Final notes

In any case, I recommend reading the book, since this list above is merely meant as a documentation recap for this repo's context.
And, once I got the base setup, then I continued over [Writing std applications](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/writing-your-own-application/std-applications/index.html).

Then, I also based my learnings on the following repositories:

- [rust-esp32-std-demo](https://github.com/ivmarkov/rust-esp32-std-demo)
- [espressif-trainings](https://github.com/esp-rs/espressif-trainings)
